      for those who suffered the inevitable and stun life;</p>

    <p>There is a place in my heart<br>
      for those embrace life however uncertain it could be;</p>

    <p>There is a place in my heart<br>
      for those who put heart and soul for the helpless;</p>

    <p>There is a place in my heart<br>
      for those whose sword of life is conscience;</p>

    <p>There is a place in my heart<br>
      for those who share life and not preach;</p>

    <p>There is always a place in my heart<br>
      for you to come abide of nothing and seek for that,<br>
      which is truth.</p>
