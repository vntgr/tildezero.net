    <h3>Is it really smart work? <span class="date">[2022-05-02]</span></h3>
    <p>Just went to a tea shop, the FM Radio played about doing smart work instead of hard work.</p>
    <p>And I heard this statement multiple times. I think that is not a valid statement to me unless I'm missing
      something.</p>
    <p>Every smartness that comes in you is the hours and days you put your effort in to mastery</p>
    <p>IOW, smart work is the asset of hard work.</p>
    <p>To put in another way, It is through the hardship, the time gives you the gift of experience which is the
      foundation for smart work.</p>
