    <h3>50 Years <span class="date">[2023-07-20]</span></h3>
    <p>Today 20th, July 2023 marks 50 years since Bruce Lee's passing on 1973. My father had told me about Bruce Lee,
      his speed, his efficacy and his life when I was a kid.</p>
    <p>Only at the very recent I started digging through his style and his teachings by reading about him and watching
      his videos.</p>
    <p>If there is one thing I learned from this spectacular teacher, that should be - There is no limit in what you do,
      in what you pursue.</p>
    <p>There is a blog post I wrote about him last year - <a
        href="https://tildezero.net/blog/my-admiration-and-respect-for-bruce-lee.html">https://tildezero.net/blog/my-admiration-and-respect-for-bruce-lee.html</a>.
